# Boboter

An ESP-IDF based firmware for the robot built in the HTL St. Pölten's EL department.

This project was created using PlatformIO, NOT the native ESP-IDF. To properly build and/or use this firmware, 
I would recommend using CLion with the PlatformIO plugin for developing, but VSCode with PlatformIO
is perfectly fine too.

### Documentation
On GitHub, the doxygen will be generated through a workflow.
