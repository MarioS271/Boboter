# Contributing to Boboter

Thank you for your interest in helping out! To keep the project safe and maintainable, please follow these steps.

(For those confused by the term PR: it stands for **Pull Request**! 😉)

## 1. Workflow
1. **Fork**: Create a copy (Fork) of the repository in your own account.
2. **Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`).
3. **Commit**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
4. **Push**: Upload the branch to **your fork**.
5. **Pull Request (PR)**: Open a PR against my `main` branch.

## 2. Pull Request Rules
- Briefly describe what you changed or added and why.
- Keep PRs small and focused on a single topic.
- **Never** push API keys, passwords, or private configuration files.

## 3. Code Style
- Ensure your code is exceptionally clean and structured. I maintain high standards to keep the codebase accessible for beginners.
- **Doxygen** documentation is mandatory for methods, namespaces and classes.
- Use comments only where absolutely necessary to explain complex logic.
- Format variables and similar using snake case (like this: `variable_name`)

## 4. Content
- Only add new libraries if there is no other way, and only after consulting with the lead developer.
- **NEVER** modify core firmware principles, such as HALs or components, without prior approval from the lead developer.
